# Notes
- You always overcook the greens :(
- You always let the steak go cold
- Original's suggestions that were left out
 - "Have this with home-made hibiscus tea" (cold and fruity) - Not Fussed, could be good in summer
 - "Have beansprouts with the noodles" - but I'm not sure they add much
- You should try serving the greens and tossing the noodles yourself in the kitchen, Zak hates the 'assemble yourself' faff

# To Start
- spice up [2x250g best rib-eye steaks] before the rest of the preparation
- get all ingredients ready on the side
- fill/boil kettle
- get out a serving bowl for each person to do the noodle in (or do this all in one big bowl)
- pans
 - griddle pan on high heat
 - large boiling saucepan on low heat (wipe with a little groundnut)
 
# Steaks
- put the meat on a board (not the one you gonna serve it on!) 
- sprinkle salt and pepper over it from a height
- pestle/mortar [1 heaped tsp Schezuan pepper]
- put a tiny pinch of the pepper in each bowl and the rest on the steaks
- sprinkle [five spice] over the steaks
- drizzle a little oil and rub the spices all over
- leave to soak in a little bit (Jamie doesn't actually recommend this so maybe not needed?)

# Dan Dan
- pour boiling water into the big pan, turn heat up to high and cover with a lid
- fill/reboil kettle
- now share among the serving bowls:
 - [4x1.5--2 tbsp of chilli oil]
 - [4x1 tbsp soy sauce]
- crush [1 clove of garlic] and share among the bowls

# Steaks
- steaks on the griddlepan for 2 mins each side

# Greens
- Season the boiling water with salt
- add [150g sugar snap peas]
- flip the meat board to do the veg on
 - half the [2 bok choi]
 - trim the ends of the [200g purple-sprouting broccoli]
 - add to the boiling water pan
- BEN: You always overcook the veg, try not to!

# Dan Dan
- Trim and finely slice the [8 spring onions]
- Divide them between the serving bowls

# Steaks
- Jamie thinks you should have been able to do all the above in 4mins!?
- the steaks should now be ready
- get a clean board (with a groove)
- Drizzle with a little oil
- peel and grate the [2cm fresh ginger], [1 clove garlic], [0.5--1 fresh red chilli] and sprinkle over the steaks
- squeeze juice of [1 lime]
- cover with foil if you think you will still be a while

# Greens
- spoon [1 heaped desert spoon of black bean sauce]
- squeeze [1 lemon or lime] juice
- drain greens, reserving water
- leave to steam a bit dry in the colander
- put the water back on the boil, with the [4 nests egg noodles] in.
- put the greens on the table ready for tossing just before eat

# Dan Dan
- add [1 organic beef stock cube] with the noodle's water
- Squeeze juice of [1 lemon] and a thimble of [runny honey] into each serving bowl

# Steaks
- Slice the steaks diagonally into 1cm strips
- toss around with all the juices
- sprinkle with [1/2 a bunch fresh coriander], roughly chopped and take to the table

# Dan Dan
- Drain the noodles (reserve a little broth)
- divide amongst the bowls (ladle over a little broth)
