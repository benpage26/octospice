# octospice
_Octospice is a prerelease codename_

This project is a Markdown/YAML inspired recipe format and associated util programs.

Currently the program is `shop_list.py [filename]`
It just extracts a list of marked up ingredients from a markdown document describing a recipe (with some simple additional constraints) and outputs it to the console.

Later it will support automatically up/down scaling the recipe for sizes and maybe auto conversion from/to metric/imperial

Maybe also, conversion between volume (ie. cups) and weight could be implemented, though accurate versions of this depend on a database of ingredient density and accurate recognition of when to apply this).  Its probably easier to just buy some measuring cups ;)
